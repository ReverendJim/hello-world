# hello-world
Learning to code. Looking for a career.

I have experience in retail / wholesale (in the fast-moving consumer-goods industries) and I have always been a computer enthusiast, right from the Commodore 64.

I have recently undertaken to make myself marketable in learning python - wish me luck. Finding it vey interesting.

Oh, I also write and compose music, with a very limited amount of success.
